{{<alert icon="question-circle" color="alert7-light" text="How to restore a cancelled request?" close="false">}} 

Find the request, press “submit again”, then the request will be open for editing. 


<br/>
{{<alert icon="question-circle" color="alert7-light" text="When is the request moved to the archive?" close="false">}} 

The request is moved to the archive in two cases:

* shipment completion,
* deleting the request in the account.

After the shipment completion the request is moved to the archive **not immediately** but when the closing documents are generated on this shipment.  <br/>
In archive lists you can find requests for the past year.

<br/>
{{<alert icon="question-circle" color="alert7-light" text="How to edit a request?" close="false">}} 

After accepting a request, changes in the request can be made by the manager who is assisting you with the request. <br/>
 If your shipment hasn’t been shipped and B/L hasn’t been issued, editing the request is impossible. <br/> Make a new request with “remake the request” and make changes in a new request, delete the previous one.

<br/>

{{<alert icon="question-circle" color="alert7-light" text="Why completed requests have status “in the process”?" close="false">}} 

As the closing documents are issued, the request will be moved to the archive.
